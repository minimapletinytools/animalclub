::TODO::
DONE D:-do constraint parameterization of Float (so we can switch to Double)
-combine all math libraries into single Math.hs module...
-fix missing-home-module warning
-fix or change the isRoot parameter in AnimalNode
-finish lookAt function, and make its interface less weird
-basic test cases
-finish goat breeding app MVP
  -just randomly breed and see what happens?
    -I think I did this already
  -try breeding to maximize volume and see what happens
  -try breeding to maximize bending joints and see what happens
-finish exporting genetics stuff to C++
-change scale to V3 instead of M33
  -see comments in reduceBoneTrans in AnimalScript.hs
-refactor
  DONE-consider deleting Hierarchical
  -move goat.hs:goatHelper into Builder.hs
  -consider moving parts of Builder.hs into Genetics

DONE-math
  IGNORE-organize Skellygen/Math ugg
  IGNORE/FAIL-finish invTRS
  DONE-it seems like the S component could have all sorts of stuff going on in it (not just shears)
    -confirm
    -update comments
    -see if this breaks our inherit and invTRS functions
IGNORE-BoneTrans refactor
  -TRS should always have a pure scale component (V3 instead of M33)
  FAIL-applyBoneTrans modifies TRS directly
DONE-refactor
  IGNORE-rename AnimalNode' to AnimalNodeInternal
  DONE-expand skellyfunc to host all possibilities
  DONE-make AnimalNode/BoneName/BoneTrans stuff have better indexing
    -`Bone T.Text [Tags]`
    -add a comment explaining how reflecting bones in AnimalNode works
      -the current implementation is weird, come up with something better
DONE-add clear documentation to how skellygen/AnimalNode skeleton hierarchy stuff works
IGNORE-go through some modules and rename things so that they don't have their modules as prefix
DONE-make separate testing library for matrix.linear
DONE-wtf are you using LHS coordinates for? Switch to RHS if possible or make it agnostic
IGNORE-add comment explaining default animal orientation assumptions
DONE-review skellygen and see if you want to redesign cuz it's weird af
